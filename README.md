![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-mit-green.svg)<br />

## Project Description

~~ Under development ~~

A MERN application to deal with food education and tackle wastage. Allows the user to query a database for foods, and add those products to a tracking list. This list allows them to keep track of when they've go something stored at home, and when it is likely to expire, or at least reduce in quality.
We need to tackle wastage in the home, and the best way will be to provide users with clear information and easy methods of tracking to keep up with modern fast-paced lifestyles.
